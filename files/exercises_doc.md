## Day 1 Version control 

### Users

How do you work on your projects? How do you save intermediate results? How do backup your projects?

### Which command(s) below would save the changes of myfile.txt to my local Git repository?

1. $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
2. $ git init myfile.txt
3. $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
4. $ git add myfile.txt
5. $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
6. $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"

### Committing Multiple Files
The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

Add some text to ``mars.txt`` noting your decision to consider Venus as a base
Create a new file ``venus.txt`` with your initial thoughts about Venus as a base for you and your friends
Add changes from both files to the staging area, and commit those changes.

### Recovering Older Versions of a File
Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning “broke” the script and it no longer runs. She has spent ~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck…

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project’s versions using Git! Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called `data_cruncher.py?`

1. `$ git checkout HEAD`
2. `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`
3. `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`
4.  ` $ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`
5. Both 2 and 4
    
### Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating on her Python script with her colleagues and realizes her last commit to the project’s repository contained an error and she wants to undo it. `git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a new commit that reverses Jennifer’s erroneous commit. Therefore `git revert` is different to `git checkout [commit ID]` because `git checkout` returns the files within the local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert` reverses changes committed to the local and project repositories.
Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use `git revert`, what is the missing command?

1. `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`
2. `Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).`
3. `git revert [commit ID]`
4. Type in the new commit message.
5. Save and close

### Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in
```
$ cd planets
$ echo "Venus is beautiful and full of love" > venus.txt
$ git add venus.txt
$ echo "Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base" >> venus.txt
$ git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"
$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt
$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```
1. Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
2. Venus is beautiful and full of love
3. Venus is beautiful and full of love
4. Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
5. Error because you have changed venus.txt without committing the changes


### Ignoring Nested Files
Given a directory structure that looks like:
```
results/data
results/plots
```
How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?

### Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`? Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

### GitHub GUI

Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub. Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says “XX commits” (where “XX” is some number). Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit. What information can you gather/explore from these buttons? How would you get that same information in the shell?

### Push vs. Commit

In this lesson, we introduced the `“git push”` command. How is `“git push”` different from `“git commit”`?

## Day 2 Collaborative distributed version control

### Exercise: Working as a project collaborator (in breakout rooms)

- Log into Github and create a new repository
- Make the repository public
- clone it to your desktop
- add some code
- push the changes to the repository
- Add one person as a collaborator (settings -> Manage Access). Make sure everyone in the group has a collaborator.
- Create an issue in the repo where you are a collaborator
- Clone that repo
- make changes on a new branch
- push the changes
- submit a Pull Request
- wait for approval
- At the same time review a collaborators Pull Request
- (Optionally) Learn about [protecting branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) and try it out.

### Exercise: Working as an external contributor (in breakout rooms)
- Remove your group member(s) as collaborators from your repository
- Fork another group members repo (Repository page, top right corner)
- Create an issue on the original repository
- Clone your forked repo to your computer
- Make some changes, use a somewhat real-world example so it makes sense to review it (but don't overdo it).
- Push it to your fork
- Make a change and commit it to the main branch
- push the changes
- make a pull request from your fork to the main repository mentioning the issue
- Consider turning your Pull Request into a draft Pull Request.
- let your code be reviewed by tagging the repo owner using (@Username)
- At the same time review Pull Request using comments on individual lines. Try to act as if it was a real peer review as much as possible.
- Accept or reject the Pull Request
- (Optionally) learn about [merge conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts) and try it out in your collaboration.


## Day 3 Introduction to Continuous Integration
### Exercise: Setup Continuous Integration on Github
In this exercise, you will:
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Commit code to the repository and set up linting with GitHub Actions
- *Linting* is the process of checking your code for errors or code style violations.

#### Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub
- **Before** you create the repository, select **"Initialize this repository
  with a README"** (otherwise you try to clone an empty repo).

#### Step 2: Clone your own repository, add code, commit, and push

Clone the repository.

Add a file `example.py` containing:

```python
def print_temperature():
    print(temperature)
```

Then stage the file (`git add <filename>`), commit (`git commit -m "some commit message"`),
and push the changes (`git push origin main`).


#### Step 3: Enable automated testing

In this step we will enable GitHub Actions.
Select "Actions" from your GitHub repository page. You get to a page
"Get started with GitHub Actions". Select the button for "Set up
this workflow" under Python Application.

GitHub creates the following file for you in the subfolder `.github/workflows`:


   ```yaml
   # This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
   # For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions

   name: Python application

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python 3.8
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: 3.8
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install flake8 pytest
           if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
       - name: Lint with flake8
         run: |
           # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
           flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
           # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
           flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
       - name: Test with pytest
         run: |
           pytest
   ```

Remove the last part:
```yaml
   - name: Test with pytest
     run: |
       pytest
```
We will get back to this in the lesson on testing.

Commit the change by pressing the "Start Commit" button.

#### Step 4: Verify that github action has been automatically run

Observe in the repository how the github action fails. While the github action is executing, the repository has a yellow marker.
This is replaced with a red check mark, once it is done.

Also browse the "Actions" tab and look at the steps there and their output.

You should be able to find that the linter complains:
``` F821 undefined name 'temperature'.```

#### Step 5: Fix the undefined name error
Indeed we forgot to define a variable `temperature`

Let's fix that:
```python
temperature = 10

def print_temperature():
    print(temperature)
```
Commit this change!

#### Step 5: Verify that github action runs succesfully
Now that you fixed the bug in your code the github action should succeed.

#### Step 6: Understanding github action yaml syntax
This is the part of the github action yaml configuration that is responsible
for the linting step:
```yaml
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```        
It basically just calls the program `flake8` with some arguments. `flake8` is a python linter.

## Day 3: Documentation lesson

### Exercise: Think of good and bad examples 
Write down your thoughts in the collaborative documents.
Respond with emojis :+1: :scream_cat: to your colleagues' answers.
- Think of projects of which you like the documentation. What do you like about them?
- Think of projects for which you don’t like the documentation. What don’t you like about them? Are you missing anything?

**NB: You can choose a mature library with lots of users for this exercise, but try to also think of less mature projects you had to collaborate on, or papers you had to reproduce.**

### Exercise: Writing good comments
Let's take a look at two example comments (comments in python start with `#`):
#### Comment A
```python
# Now we check if temperature is larger then -50:
if temperature > -50:
    print('do something')
```

#### Comment B
```python
# We regard temperatures below -50 degrees as measurement errors
if temperature > -50:
    print('do something')
```
 Which of these comments is best? Can you explain why?
 Write your answer in the collaborative document (before looking at others' answers)
 
###Adding in-code documentation

 Update this code snippet so it is well-documented:

 ```python
 import pandas as pd
 
 def x(a, print_columns=False):
    b = pd.read_excel(a)
    column_headers = list(b.columns.values)
    if print_columns:
        print("\n".join(column_headers))
    return column_headers
 ```
 1. Work individually on your solution (5 minutes)
 2. One person screen-shares their solution, discuss and together settle on a final solution. (5 minutes)
 3. Share final solution in collaborative document.

 ### Exercise: Write a README file
 You are going to write a README file for an example project.

 #### The example project
 Here's [the example project](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project).
 For this project we transformed the code snippets from the previous episode into a single script [analyse_spreadsheet.py](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project/blob/main/analyse_spreadsheet.py)
 
 Let's take a look at [the script](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project/blob/main/analyse_spreadsheet.py). 
 You don't need to understand the script completely, all you need to know is:
 * The functions `mean_temperature` and `get_spreadsheet_columns` from previous episode are in there.
 * We added a `main` function that is called when you run the script 
 (you could run this python script by calling `python analyse_spreadsheet.py` on the command line). 
 It will prompt the user for a file name, print the columns in the spreadsheet, and print the mean
 temperature.
 
 That's all there is to this project! (You can ignore the other files in the repository, we'll get back to them in episode 4)

 #### The exercise (20 minutes)
 1. Fork [the example project](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project) to your own github namespace
 2. Add a file called `README.md` (you can use the github web interface or work locally (i.e. `git clone`, edit the file,  `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`))
 3. Add some content to your README file. Think about what you want the audience to know about your project! 
    It does not matter whether the information is correct, it is more important that you have all the components that make up a good README file.
 4. Note that the README file is nicely rendered on the github repository page.
 5. Discuss your ideas on a good README file in the breakout room. What should definitely be included? Write down a short list in the collaborative document.

 NB: The `README.md` file is written in 'Markdown' a very popular lightweight markup language, all you need to know for now is this syntax:
 ```
 # A section title
 ## A subsection title
 Normal text
 
 A list with items
 - item1
 - item2
 ```
  
 (Optional): Use [https://hemingwayapp.com/](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to analyse your README file and make your writing bold and clear!

### Exercise: Github Pages (15 minutes)
Follow instructions on https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/coderefinery-documentation/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/05-gh-pages.md

Paste a link to your github page in the collaborative document.

## Testing lesson

### Exercise 1: Discussion

- Why do you write tests/ Why do you not write tests?
- Write reasons into the collabroative document?

### Testing locally (25min)

Please use https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/pytest/

### Testing as part of the CI (15min)

Add the following to your github actions workflow file from yesterday. 

```
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest example.py
```


Add these functions to your ``example.py``:
```python=
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add('space', 'ship') == 'spaceship'


def subtract(a, b):
    return a + b  # <--- fix this 


# uncomment the following test
#def test_subtract():
#    assert subtract(2, 3) == -1
```

See what the CI does now and then uncomment the ``test_substract`` test.See what the CI does now, Afterwards fix the ``subtract`` function.

### Exercise 4: Test design (35min)

Write tests for the following functions/classes. Also test the error condition:
```python
#1
def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of n.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError('received negative input')
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result


# 2
def count_word_occurrence_in_string(text, word):
    """
    Counts how often word appears in text.
    Example: if text is "one two one two three four"
             and word is "one", then this function returns 2
    """
    words = text.split()
    return words.count(word)


# 3
def count_word_occurrence_in_file(file_name, word):
    """
    Counts how often word appears in file file_name.
    Example: if file contains "one two one two three four"
             and word is "one", then this function returns 2
    """
    count = 0
    with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            words = line.split()
            count += words.count(word)
    return count


# 4
def check_reactor_temperature(temperature_celsius):
    """
    Checks whether temperature is above max_temperature
    and returns a status.
    """
    from reactor import max_temperature
    if temperature_celsius > max_temperature:
        status = 1
    else:
        status = 0
    return status


# 5
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hunger = 0
    def go_for_a_walk(self):  # <-- how would you test this function?
        self.hunger += 1
        
```

## Modular Code Design

### Follow along 1:
- Propose ways to improve the code by addding them to the collaborative document.
